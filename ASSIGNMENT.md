# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> The creator of the module I wrote had a lot of examples and a descriptive README. However, they didn't comment the code very thoroughly, which made it hard to disect. I had to utilize my own knowledge and his examples to create comments.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> A comment should go beyond the lines of code. It should explain the why of the function as opposed to how. The purpose of a function should be deducible from its name/parameters. The comment shoudl explain why the parameters/funciton exists.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 5 or so hours. 


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I asked questions about the syntax of my module and found answers on Stack Overflow.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I think the big thing is that some students won't know about syntax of JS and some things will confuse them. A big thing for me was learning about ternary operators, specifically "? :". When I first saw that I was very confused, and had to look it up. I don't think there's anything that can really make this better. It's not too terrible of a problem if you can use Google.
